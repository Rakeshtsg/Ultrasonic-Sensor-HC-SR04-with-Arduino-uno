WORKING 
Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04 is a sensor that can measure distance. It emits an ultrasound at 40 000 Hz (40kHz) which travels through the air and if there is an object or obstacle on its path It will bounce back to the module. Considering the travel time and the speed of the sound you can calculate the distance.
The configuration pin of HC-SR04 is VCC (1), TRIG (2), ECHO (3), and GND (4). The supply voltage of VCC is +5V and you can attach TRIG and ECHO pin to any Digital I/O in 
your Arduino Board.
